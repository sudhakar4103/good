Expert System for Medical Advice
I built a minimal rule-based expert system. Theory:
- Prompts the user for a symptom and uses hard-coded rules to advise:
* 'fever' -> General Medicine.
* 'injury' -> Emergency & Orthopedics.
* 'chest' or 'pain' -> Cardiology.
* 'checkup' -> Routine General Medicine.
- If no rule matches, provides a default suggestion to consult reception.
- In a full expert system, you'd separate:
* Knowledge base (facts and rules).
* Inference engine (forward/backward chaining).
* User interface.
