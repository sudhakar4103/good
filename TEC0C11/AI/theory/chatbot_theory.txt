Elementary Chatbot
I created a simple rule-based chatbot. Theory:
- Uses an infinite loop (while True) to continuously read user input.
- Normalizes input to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
- Checks for specific keywords:
* 'bye' to exit.
* 'hello' or 'hi' for greetings.
* 'price' for product information.
- Default fallback for unrecognized queries.
- This design is straightforward but not scalable-real chatbots use NLP and state machines.
